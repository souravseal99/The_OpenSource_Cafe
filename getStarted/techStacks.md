### Side-Note
  1. The projects for now, are not arranged according to any superioirty,  
     rather they are mostly arranged alphabetically. 
     
  2. I should have added a brief description about what the project does,  
     and about who is/are the maintainers of the project, but all of the  
     projects already does have really cool ReadMe-s, so why reinvent the  
     wheel. :)
