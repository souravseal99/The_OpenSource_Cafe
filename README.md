# The OpenSource Cafe ðŸŽˆ

## Why ?

To put it in a single line - 

> **_This is a repository to keep track of some great projects to contribute for Everyone._**

It's really difficult for most of us to look for a good project to contribute, specially  
when we are starting out with our Open Source Journey. So here we'll try to list down  
some of our fevourite projects from different categories and Tech Stack.

This will be helpfull for both Contributors, as well as for Project Maintainers.  
Often after an Open Source Programme ends (typically after two or three months )  
the list of projects goes out of our sight. 

Open Source is always about **Collaboration** and **not Competition**.  
The goal should be to contribute to the project even after the event ends.

## How to Help
    Simple...!
    You can Just Raise an Issue and make a PR with the name 
    and link of your fev projects. Also, Obviously Feel free 
    to share if you have any suggestions. 

## Some More Plans (to make it easy for newcomers)
1. Giving a difficulty tag to the projects
2. Sorting the more maintained projects Up
